# Powdered Infant Formula sampling simulation 
This is a repository created and maintained by Minho Kim and Xianbin (Eric) Cheng. It is built for a project supported by The Institute for the Advancement of Food and Nutrition Sciences (IAFNS) Food Microbiology Committee, the name of the project is "Simulating Powdered Product Sampling to Improve Food Safety Sampling Plans".   

## Objective
The goal of this simulation is to be able to simulate different Cronobacter contamination types that can occur in the PIF lot and different sampling plans for exploring power of sampling plans to detect the contamination. 

## Introduction
Cronobacter is a risk in Powdered Infant Formula (PIF) products that is hard to detect due to localized and low-level contamination. We adapted a previously published sampling simulation to PIF sampling and benchmarked industry-relevant sampling plans across different numbers of grabs, total sample mass, and sampling patterns. 

## How to use
Please refer to the SOP for 1D simulation model WORD document for instruction for downloading the target version. Then, open the Final simulation module R Markdown file to run the simulation.
